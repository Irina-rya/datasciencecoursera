```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# I may create Markdown documents

## Code Chunks

To insert a code chunk, press **Ctrl + Alt + I** in the source pane (top left pane in the default settings of RStudio).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + geom_point()
```

## Including Plots

I can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
data(USJudgeRatings)
plot(USJudgeRatings$DECI, USJudgeRatings$PREP,
     main="Relationship Between Judge Preparation and Decisions",
     pch=16, col="blue")
```
